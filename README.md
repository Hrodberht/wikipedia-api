# Wikipedia API - Search Engine

This Wikipedia API project uses Wikipedia's public API to create a search application where users can input search terms and retrieve results from Wikipedia. If the search yields any results, information will be displayed in card format, where each link will direct the user to its respective Wikipedia page. If the search does not yield any results, an error will be displayed.
